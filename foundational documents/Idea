# Problems

Many young people want to save money — but they don’t know where their income goes each month.
Most people rely on traditional expense apps, which require manual data entry and offer little guidance. After a few days, they lose motivation and stop tracking.

As a result:

- They overspend without realizing it
- They can’t visualize progress toward goals
- Saving becomes something they *want* to do, but *never actually start*

There’s a need for a **smart, effortless system** that helps users manage spending and create achievable saving plans — automatically.

# **Idea – SmartMoney**

**SmartMoney** is an AI-powered web app that helps young people manage spending and achieve saving goals — *without manual effort.*

Users can:

- **Add expenses** by typing, **scanning receipts (OCR)**, or **using voice (STT)**.
- **View their financial dashboard** with clear charts and spending insights.
- **Set saving goals**, and let **AI (CLOVA Studio + PuLP)** generate a personalized plan showing how much to save each month and which expenses to reduce.

The goal is to turn personal finance from a boring, repetitive task into a **simple, smart, and motivating experience** — helping users save money faster and more consistently.

# Users

Minh is a 25-year-old office worker in Ho Chi Minh City.

Every month, he tells himself: *“This time I’ll finally save at least two million.”* But by the end of the month, he has no idea where all his money went. He’s tried several expense-tracking apps before — but they all feel like work.

Every time he spends, he has to **open the app, type in the amount, choose a category**, and remember to save. After a few days, he simply gives up.

⇒ With SmartMoney, Minh can:

- When he buys a coffee, he wants to **snap a photo of the receipt**, not type it.
- When he’s riding, he wants to **say “Add 50,000 for gas today”**, and have it logged automatically.
- See his monthly spending visualized clearly in a dashboard
- Ask AI to generate a saving plan based on his habits and goal
