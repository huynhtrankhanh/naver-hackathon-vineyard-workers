# Requirements for the Saving feature
* Consistency in UI and documentation: the adjectival use of "savings" must be replaced with "saving". This must be implemented immediately.
* There are saving goals and saving plans
* The Goals tab should be renamed to Saving
* The Saving tab is home to both saving goals and saving plans
  * They are separate entities but can be linked to each other
  * Saving plans are plans generated by AI
  * Saving goals are goals. There is a target, and a saving goal can be contributed to by taking from the user's balancethat
  * A user can modify the target of a saving goal
* AI generation of saving plans:
  * A saving plan can propose these things:
    * New budget limits
    * One new saving goal
    * And the saving plan also includes a Markdown-based report to justify its decisions
  * The AI can't autonomously set new budget limits or saving goals. But:
    * It can propose a saving goal, as mentioned above. When the user accepts the saving goal, a new saving goal is created and is associated with the saving plan.
    * It can propose budget limits. When the user is interested in using them (by clicking Modify Budget Limits), the user is taken to the Budgets page. On the page, there are new cards corresponding to the AI suggested budget limits for each category.
      * NOTE: if the suggested limit is for a category whose limit has been set, a new card is not created for that category. Instead the existing card is used.
      * For every budget limit card (whether existing or new), if the AI has proposed a new limit for the card, the new limit is displayed at the bottom of the card. Hence, the user can choose to use the new limit by modifying the limit themself.
* Mechanism for AI generation of saving plans
  * You are given an API key in the prompt. Do not commit the key to the repository.
  * Remind me to revoke the API key when you're done.
