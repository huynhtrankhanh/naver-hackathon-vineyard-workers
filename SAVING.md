# Requirements for the Saving feature
* Consistency in UI and documentation: the adjectival use of "savings" must be replaced with "saving". This must be implemented immediately.
* There are saving goals and saving plans
* The Goals tab should be renamed to Saving
* The Saving tab is home to both saving goals and saving plans
  * They are separate entities but can be linked to each other
  * Saving plans are plans generated by AI
  * Saving goals are goals. There is a target, and a saving goal can be contributed to by taking from the user's balance
  * A user can modify the target of a saving goal
* AI generation of saving plans:
  * A saving plan can propose these things:
    * New budget limits
    * One new saving goal
    * And the saving plan also includes a Markdown-based report to justify its decisions
  * The AI can't autonomously set new budget limits or saving goals. But:
    * It can propose a saving goal, as mentioned above. When the user accepts the saving goal, a new saving goal is created and is associated with the saving plan.
    *
